# Release v0.0.1-alpha-20251229

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Build & CI
- **Fixed TypeScript compilation errors** that were blocking CI builds
  - Removed unused imports in `CronJobDetails.tsx` (`Activity` and `Clock` from lucide-react)
  - Added missing type annotation for `newContent` parameter in YAML editor callback
- **Fixed `.gitignore` configuration** that was incorrectly blocking access to source code
  - Changed overly broad `logs` pattern to only ignore log files (`*.log`, `npm-debug.log*`, etc.)
  - Source code in `src/components/features/logs/` is now properly accessible

### Developer Experience
- **Improved build reliability**: All TypeScript errors resolved, ensuring clean builds in CI/CD pipeline
- **Better gitignore patterns**: More precise patterns prevent accidental blocking of source files while still ignoring generated logs
